<h1>What is SUSTAINA-OP?</h1>

SUSTAINA-OP is the 6th generation kid-sized autonomous mobile robot for RoboCup Humanoid Leadge developed at CIT Brains.

This robot is the successor to GankenKun, the 5th generation robot being developed for RoBoCup 2022 starting in 2021.

Click [here](https://github.com/citbrains/OpenPlatform) for Gankenkun's open platform.

The robot is being developed with two main objectives in mind.

1. The robot should have high rigidity and durability and be difficult to break.

2. The robot should be easy to manufacture and maintain for long-term use.

## What is SUSTAINA-OP&trade; ?
SUSTAINA-OP&trade; is an open hardware platform developed to reduce the high cost of developing robot hardware. It is designed by Masato Kubotera, based on the "[Gankenkun](https://github.com/citbrains/OpenPlatform)" robot series developed by Hiroaki Shimoyoshi. SUSTAINA-OP&trade; was adopted as the official robot of the team "[CIT Brains](https://github.com/citbrains)" of Chiba Institute of Technology in Japan, and won the world championship of RoboCup Humanoid League KidSize in 2022.

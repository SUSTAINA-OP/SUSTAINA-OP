  <h2>
    What is SUSTAINA-OP<sup>TM</sup> ?
  </h2>
  <p>
    SUSTAINA-OP<sup>TM</sup> is the open hardware platform for the RoboCup Humanoid League KidSize. The robot was developed as a humanoid hardware platform with the objective of overcoming the barrier of high hardware development costs associated with participation in the RoboCup Humanoid League. <br>
    SUSTAINA-OP<sup>TM</sup> is designed and published by Masato Kubotera of the Humanoid League Kid Size Team "CIT Brains" in Japan. The kinematic structure of SUSTAINA-OP<sup>TM</sup> is based on <a href="https://github.com/citbrains/OpenPlatform">GankenKun</a>, the 5th generation robots from CIT Brains used for RoboCup 2017-2019. The actual robots of SUSTAINA-OP<sup>TM</sup> is made by the members of CIT Brains and used for various software and research developments.<br>
    SUSTAINA-OP<sup>TM</sup> was officially adopted as the robots of CIT Brains from RoboCup 2022 and won first place* in the RoboCup Humanoid League KidSize at the same competition.
